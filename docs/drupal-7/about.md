## About OpenCRM

> [OpenCRM](https://drupal.org/project/opencrm) is a fully featured native Drupal CRM solution based on the Party Module with the aim of having a comparable feature set to other popular CRM systems such as CiviCRM.

If you are looking to build your CRM Solution in Drupal 7. Look at OpenCRM or OpenCRM Kickstart on Drupal.org.

We are not going to focus on this any more here because this site is primarily about CRM in Drupal 8.
